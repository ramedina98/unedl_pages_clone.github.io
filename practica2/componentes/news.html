                Another bloodletting is underway between Israel and Hamas. 
                Hamas started the latest round by launching a well-coordinated 
                missile and ground attack on Israel, including the kidnapping 
                of some number of Israeli soldiers and civilians and the 
                temporary seizure of several border communities. To say Israel 
                was caught off guard is an understatement, but Prime Minister 
                Benjamin Netanyahu has declared that Israel is now “at war,” 
                and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are retaliating, just as 
                they have done on previous occasions.
                <br><br>
                Predictably, each side blames the other. Israel and its 
                supporters portray Hamas as nothing but a brutal gang of 
                Iranian-backed terrorists who have deliberately attacked 
                civilians in particularly disturbing ways. Palestinians and 
                their supporters acknowledge that attacking civilians is wrong 
                but blame Israel for imposing an apartheid regime over its 
                Palestinian subjects and subjecting them to systematic and 
                disproportionate violence over many decades. They also point 
                out that international law permits oppressed peoples to resist 
                unlawful occupation, even if the methods Hamas has chosen are 
                illegitimate.
                <br><br>
                What are we to make of this shocking event? Unlike Paul Poast, 
                I don’t see the fighting as further evidence that the global 
                security order is deteriorating. Why not? Because this is 
                hardly the first time that large-scale violence has erupted 
                between Israel and Hamas. Israel pummeled the Gaza Strip 
                during Operation Cast Lead in December 2008, did it again in 
                Operation Protective Edge in 2014, and then did so once more (
                on a smaller scale) in May 2021. These attacks killed 
                several thousand civilians (perhaps a quarter of them 
                children) and further impoverished the trapped population 
                of Gaza, but they didn’t bring us any closer to a lasting 
                and just solution. It was, as some Israelis commented, 
                just a case of “mowing the lawn.”
                <br><br>
                The novel feature of this latest round of fighting is that 
                Hamas achieved near-total surprise (much as Egypt and Syria 
                did 50 years ago, during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War) and has 
                demonstrated unexpected combat capabilities. The attack 
                inflicted more harm on Israel than any of its previous 
                operations; more than 700 Israelis have reportedly been 
                killed, with the death toll expected to rise, and an unknown 
                number have been captured, including some IDF soldiers.
                <br><br>
                The attack has clearly shocked Israeli society. The government’s 
                failure to detect or prevent the attack may eventually mark the 
                end of Netanyahu’s political career, and like the intelligence 
                failure back in 1973, it is likely to lead to recriminations 
                inside Israel that will reverberate for years. But Hamas is still 
                much weaker than Israel, and the fighting is not going to shift the 
                overall balance of power between them. Israel will almost certainly 
                retaliate harshly, and Palestinian civilians in Gaza and elsewhere—including 
                many who do not support Hamas—will pay a high price.
                <br><br>
                No one knows for certain where this crisis is headed or what 
                the long-term impact will be, but here are some tentative 
                conclusions.
